# React + Vite

In the front end, I have used React, HTML, CSS, and some npm packages to create a responsive kitchen recipe management application. In this application, users can add, edit, and save recipes, and create accounts. I have also implemented authentication and authorization; for example, users can't save recipes without registering or logging in, and each user can view only what they have created.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
